	</head>
	<body>
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			The idea for the ScroOoge is borrowed from
			<a href="http://martin.kleppmann.de/">Martin Kleppmann</a>
			who wrote the first "Scrooge" - a command line based perl program.
			His program became popular amongst his friends at Corpus Christi College
			in Cambridge (England) in 2005 [please correct me if this is wrong!].
			At its hights about 30 people have been using it [please correct me again!].
			Unfortunately the number of active users decreased to only a handful as
			the friends graduated from university.
		</p>
		
		<h2>The Current ScroOoge</h2>
		<p>
			The current web ScroOoge was started by Patrick Dietrich when working
			with Martin in his company (<a href="http://eptcomputing.com">Ept Computing</a>)
			in Cambridge in 2008. The design is written by Jens Scherbl who met Patrick
			during their time in Ulm (Germany) (have a look at some of Jens' other Projects here:
			<a href="http://www.instantbonsai.net/">http://www.instantbonsai.net</a>)
		</p>
		<p>
			We hope that you enjoy using the ScroOoge and that it helps you solve
			a common problem. Please let us know, what you like or don't like about the ScroOoge
			to help us making it as useful as possible!
